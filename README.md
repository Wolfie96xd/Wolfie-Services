As a Minecraft plugin and server configurator, I have gained extensive experience in creating and customizing Minecraft servers for a variety of communities and individual users. Over the past four years, I have worked on projects ranging from small buddy servers to large server networks, and have developed an in-depth knowledge of Minecraft plugins and their interaction with the server.

My ability to select and configure appropriate plugins for each server is one of my greatest strengths, allowing me to optimize performance and ensure a smooth and satisfying game experience for users.

My focus on client communication and attention to detail has also been instrumental in my success as a Minecraft plugin and server configurator. **I am always willing to work closely with clients to understand their needs and ensure the server is exactly what they are looking for.**

`In summary, my experience in configuring Minecraft plugins and servers over the past two years has made me an expert in Minecraft server customization and optimization, with a focus on customer satisfaction and quality of service.`

Among the most notable servers I worked on were:

- VirtualHit
- TimeLineMc
- VolcanoMc
- Geopolotic Era

For more than 3 years I have been and still am part of [ClankyHosting's](https://discord.gg/TrspvYdpGJ) staff.
I started working for this company three years ago, working in the support department. During this time, I gained valuable knowledge about server error handling and developed solid skills to solve problems efficiently. This experience allowed me to understand the importance of maintaining server stability and functionality, as well as customer satisfaction. Since then, I have continued to hone my skills and expand my expertise in server configuration and optimization to provide effective and quality solutions to my clients.
Currently I hold the position of System Manager, therefore I am in charge of leading and supervising the integral management of the systems, ensuring their optimal operation and performance.
